## Specific to RubyMotion (use of CocoaPods):
#
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control

## Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/
#config/database.yml
# for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
# intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
Gemfile.lock
db/schema.rb
log/development.log
log/workers.log
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset
config/puma.rb

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
.rbenv-vars
